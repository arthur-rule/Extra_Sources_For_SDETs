Linux: The Silent Open-Source Pioneer in Technological Progress and Innovation


I could fill pages discussing the strengths of Linux; to merely praise it would be an
understatement, considering the extraordinary achievement of Linus Torvalds.

For the average user, Linux is extremely boring, plain, and an operating system that
seemingly solves nothing. This holds true for that user. As long as I can remember,
Linux enthusiasts prefer to belittle and criticize these users, which I think is unfair.

However, Linux is the overlooked hero behind the scenes in the computer world. The description
spoken at the closing scene of "The Dark Knight" film applies perfectly to Linux:
"Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector.
A dark knight."

If it weren't for Linux, many developments in the computer world wouldn't be possible,
numerous products and services would be much more expensive, and worse, there could be
a monopoly by Windows.

Let me explain with some examples from today:

A significant portion of artificial intelligence-related work is done on the Linux
operating system. Those conducting these studies first experiment with them on Linux
(Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), then publish articles, and upload them to GitHub. Many projects
operate on Linux, and applications related to Windows come out later. Therefore, you
have to install a Linux distribution to run some applications.

The reasonable pricing policy of hosting companies and our easy access to websites are
mostly thanks to Linux. Many hosting companies predominantly use Linux on their servers.

Android, as you know, is an operating system developed by modifying the Linux kernel.
This has made smartphones accessible to everyone. Today, Android is the most widely
used operating system on mobile phones.

Thanks to Linux, open-source software has a chance to come to life. Otherwise, a system
constantly paying tribute to Microsoft and Apple would be established, and these
companies would sell their products at a higher price due to profit greed.


For example, the existence of programs like OpenOffice and LibreOffice prevents Microsoft
Office from skyrocketing in price. Yes, none of them is an Excel because there is no
highly motivated group of programmers working diligently in the background with
salary expectations. But at least you have an alternative to get through the day
and exert invisible pressure on Microsoft.

Even former Internet Explorer users will know that the emergence and development
of alternatives like Firefox saved us from a torment of viruses, ads, and sluggish
performance.

VLC Media Player, for instance, an open-source powerhouse video player, outperforms
Windows Media Player by miles. I still actively use it, and it works faster and
more efficiently than many video players.

Linux is used not only in what I've mentioned but also in every sector you can think of.
 In the defense industry, in the computers used for the Large Hadron Collider
 in Switzerland, in scientific projects, etc.
Linux is a monopoly breaker, it's free, it's open source, and it's a platform that
contributes to humanity's technological advancement.To conclude, here's a brief comparison:

Linux:
Strengths: Linux is known for its stability, security, and customization options.
It is open-source, meaning the source code is freely available, allowing users to
modify and distribute their versions. Linux is widely used for server environments,
development, and in various embedded systems.
Challenges: It may have a steeper learning curve for some users, especially those
accustomed to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) prevalent in Windows and macOS.

Windows:
Strengths: Windows is widely used and has a vast selection of software and games.
It provides a user-friendly interface, broad hardware compatibility, and is often
the preferred platform for many commercial applications.
Challenges: It is a proprietary system, meaning the source code is not publicly available.
Some users may experience stability issues, and it is a common target for malware
due to its popularity.

macOS:
Strengths: macOS is known for its sleek design, user-friendly interface, and seamless
integration with other Apple devices. It provides a Unix-based environment, which can be
appealing to developers. It's often praised for its aesthetics and user experience.
Challenges: macOS is limited to Apple hardware, which can be more expensive. Software
availability may be more restricted compared to Windows.
