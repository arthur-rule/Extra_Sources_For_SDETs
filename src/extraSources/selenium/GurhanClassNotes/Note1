1- What is HTML?
	- Hypertext Markup Language
	- HTML is not a programming language.
	- It is a markup language.


===========================================================================
2- What makes a markup language?
	- MARK UP TAGS

3- What is a mark up TAG?
	- It acts like a container.
	- Tags will determine the behavior of a web element.



===========================================================================

4- How many types of mark up tags we have?
	- Two types of tags.

	#1 - Paired Tags:
		- It consists of 2 parts.

		syntax:

		<openingTag> CONTENT/TEXT </closingTag>

		ex: p, h1-h6, div, head, body, table, ul, li, select, a

	#2 - Unpaired Tags:
		- Self-closing tags.
		- It consists of 1 part.

		syntax:

		</selfClosingTag >

		ex: br, hr, input, img





===========================================================================
5- What is a web element?
	- Everything we see on a web page is a WEB ELEMENT.
	- Such as: links, buttons, texts

===========================================================================
6- What is attribute?
	- Attributes provide additional information about specific web element.
    - Attributes go inside of the OPENING TAG ONLY. 
    - If it is an unpaired tag/self closing tag it will go inside of the tag itself.
    - A web element can have as many attributes as needed. Number is not limited.

ex: 
    <div style="color:red;"> content </div>
    
    <img src="cyberTruckimage.png">


	<a href="https://www.google.com"> google </a>
	</img src="">

===========================================================================

PRACTICE:

    <a href="https://www.etsy.com"> ETSY - SELL YOUR COOKIES </a>
	<-----------opening tag-------> 						 </closingTag>

#1- WHAT IS THE TEXT OF THIS TAG? WHAT IS THE CONTENT, WHAT IS DISPLAYED ON THE PAGE?

-->	"ETSY - SELL YOUR COOKIES"

#2- WHAT IS THE ATTIRBUTE OF THIS WEB ELEMENT?

-->	href

#3- WHAT IS THE ATTRIBUTE VALUE OF HREF?

-->	https://www.etsy.com

#4- WHAT IS THE TYPE OF THIS TAG?

-->	a

===========================================================================

TELLING WHAT IS WHAT FROM THE COLORS:

PURPLE	: TAG NAME
ORANGE	: ATTRIBUTE NAME
BLUE	: ATTRIBUTE VALUE
BLACK	: TEXT OF THE WEB ELEMENT


===========================================================================

What is Maven?
	- A "build" automation tool.

What is a build?
	- A build is some repeated steps when we create a project and deploy it.
	- There is something called "a build life cycle"

- Maven is not a tool for TESTERS.

 - selenium-project
 	- src
 		- main : developers write their application code in this folder
 		- test : developers write their tests
 	- pom.xml  : this file is the most important file in a maven project.
 		- we can control (add, remove, change) our dependencies and their versions.

 		- .idea  : IntelliJ is keeping the project preferences in this folder
 		- target : The compiled code of our project is kept in this folder.
 			- We won't see this folder unless we run our code, and we turn the setting from the "gear icon."
 				- gear icon > tree appearance > show excluded files


===========================================================================

What should we pay attention in a Selenium method?
1- What does this method do?
2- What does this method return? Does it have a return type?
3- Does it accept argument?
4- Does it throw a specific EXCEPTION?

===========================================================================

--> .get(STRING URL) method?

	1- What does this method do?
		- This method will get the given URL in an already opened browser.

	2- Does it have a return type?
		- This method does not have a return type.

	3- Does it accept argument?
		- Yes.
		- It accepts a String arg for URL.

	4- Does it throw a specific EXCEPTION?
		- IllegalArgumentException if not provided with correct https:// URL

===========================================================================

--> Basic navigations:

	- We combine .navigate() method with some other methods to achieve basic navigations.

	- navigate().forward(); --> this will go to forward page (if any)
	- navigate().back();	--> this will go to back page (if any)
	- navigate().refresh(); --> this will refresh the page
	- navigate().to(URL)	--> this will go to given URL (just like .get() method)


===========================================================================

--> .getTitle();

	1- What does this method do?
		- This method will get the title of the current page.

	2- What does this method return? Does it have a return type?
		- Yes, it returns a String.
		- It will return the current title as a String.

	3- Does it accept argument?
		- No, it doesn't accept any arguments.

	4- Does it throw a specific EXCEPTION?
		- No.


===========================================================================

Thread.sleep()
	- This is not Selenium method.
	- It comes from java, and it will basically stop the execution of the code for given duration.
	- If we pass 2000 milliseconds, it will wait/stop for 2 seconds.


===========================================================================

- .getCurrentUrl();

	1- What does this method do?
		- It will get the URL of the current page.

	2- What does this method return? Does it have a return type?
		- Yes. It will return a String.
		- It will return the current URL as a String.

	3- Does it accept argument?
		- No. It doesn't accept any argument.

	4- Does it throw a specific EXCEPTION?
		- No.


===========================================================================

- driver.manage().window().maximize();

	- this line will maximize the currently opened browser.
	- this is the line that will work for both Mac and Windows.

- driver.manage().window().fullscreen();
	- this usually just works for Mac, because only Mac has "fullscreen" functionality.


===========================================================================

- driver.close();
	- this method will close the currently focused window/tab

- driver.quit();
	- this will close all of the currently opened windows/tabs
	- this will also end the session.

- but if we have just 1 window open, both will just close that window.

===========================================================================

What is a session?
	- A new session is created every time we run our selenium code.
	- We can end the session using driver.quit() method, or it will naturally end when the code execution is done.
