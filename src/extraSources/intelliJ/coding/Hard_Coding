-- "Hard Coding" refers to the practice of directly embedding specific values into your code instead of using variables.

        1-It means explicitly putting the actual values in your code wherever they are needed, without abstraction or flexibility. While it may seem convenient in some cases, hard coding is generally considered a bad practice for several reasons:

        2-Lack of Flexibility: Hard coding makes your code inflexible and difficult to maintain. If you need to change a value, you have to manually search for and modify every occurrence of that value in your code. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.

        Reduced Reusability: Hard coding limits the reusability of your code. If you embed specific values directly into your code, it becomes challenging to reuse that code in different contexts or scenarios. You would have to modify the code for each new situation, leading to duplicated code.

        Code Fragility: Hard coding increases the fragility of your code. If you hard code values that may change over time, such as URLs, file paths, or configuration settings, you'll need to modify the code whenever those values change. This can introduce bugs and make your code more prone to errors.

        Readability and Maintainability: Hard-coded values can make your code less readable and harder to understand. Without proper variable names, it becomes difficult to interpret the purpose or significance of specific values in your code.

        To avoid hard coding, it's better to use variables, constants, or configuration files. By avoiding hard coding and adopting these practices, you'll make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable. Your code will be easier to understand, modify, and adapt to different scenarios or requirements.

        As summary:
        Hardcoding means embedding fixed values directly into the source code, making it inflexible and difficult to update.
        the opposite of hard coding is not soft coding it is Parameterization (or configuration)involves using variables, constants, or configuration files to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
