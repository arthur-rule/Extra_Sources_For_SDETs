        //Division: Division is a basic arithmetic operation in math that represents the process of distributing or sharing a quantity into equal parts or groups. It is the inverse operation of multiplication
        //Dividend = (Divisor * Quotient) + Remainder
        //  20     = (   3    *    6    ) +    2

        //Dividend: The dividend is the number that is being divided.
        //Divisor: The divisor is the number by which the dividend is divided.
        //Quotient: The quotient is the result of the division operation. It represents the number of times the divisor can be subtracted from the dividend.
        //Remainder: the amount left over after the division process is completed that is not evenly divisible by the divisor.
