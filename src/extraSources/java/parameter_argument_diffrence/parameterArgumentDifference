Parameter / Argument
• A parameter act as inputs for a method. When a method is created it is
possible to define certain variables that are used within the method.
Parameters are local variables to the method
• An argument is the actual value given when calling the method. When you
want to use a method, if there was a parameter defined it means an
argument must be provided matching the defined datatype for the
program to compile and run
