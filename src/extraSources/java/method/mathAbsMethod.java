        /* Math.abs() returns the absolute (Positive) value of an int value.
         This method gives the absolute value of the argument.
         The argument can be int, double, long and float.
         Absolute value refers to the positive value corresponding to the number
         passed as in arguments. No matter what be it positive or
         negative number been passed for computation,
         the computation will occur over the positive corresponding number in both cases.
         So in order to compute the absolute value for any number we do have a specified
         method in Java referred to as abs() present inside Math class present
         inside java.lang package. The java.lang.Math.abs() returns the absolute
         value of a given argument:
             If the argument is not negative, the argument is returned.
             If the argument is negative, the negation of the argument is returned.

        In Java, there is no specific math.abs method. However, there is a Math.abs()
        method provided by the java.lang.Math class. This method is used to find the
        absolute value of a given number. The syntax is as follows:  */

        int someNumber = -4;
        double absoluteValue = Math.abs(someNumber);

//        Here, someNumber is the numeric value for which you want to find the absolute
//        value, and absoluteValue will store the result.

        double number = -10.5;
        double absoluteValue2 = Math.abs(number);
        System.out.println("Absolute value: " + absoluteValue2);

//        In this case, the output would be: Absolute value: 10.5
//        The Math.abs() method is commonly used when you want to ensure that
//        a value is non-negative, regardless of its original sign.
