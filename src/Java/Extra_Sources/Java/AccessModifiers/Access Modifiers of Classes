In Java, classes can also have access modifiers that determine their visibility.
The access modifiers for classes are similar to those for class members
(fields and methods). Here are the accessibility levels for classes:

Public:
A class declared as public is accessible from any other class.
There are no restrictions on accessing public classes.

public class PublicClass {
    // Class definition
}

Default (Package-Private):
If no access modifier is specified (default), it is also known as package-private.
A class with default access is accessible only within the same package.
It is not visible outside the package.

class DefaultClass {
    // Class definition
}

Final:
The final keyword, when applied to a class, indicates that the class cannot be
subclassed (i.e., it cannot be extended).

public final class FinalClass {
    // Class definition
}

Abstract:
The abstract keyword, when applied to a class, indicates that the class cannot
be instantiated on its own and must be subclassed.

public abstract class AbstractClass {
    // Abstract class definition
}

These access modifiers for classes help in controlling the visibility and usage
of classes within a program. It's important to choose the appropriate access
level based on the design and requirements of your application.
